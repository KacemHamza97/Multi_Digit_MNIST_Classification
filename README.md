# Multi_Digit_MNIST_Classification

Given a dataset of two-digit handwritten numbers. The goal is to design and train a classifier
that can predict the number from the input image. In this notebook I trained a deep learning model
(similar to RESNET ) along with an SVC classifier(used as a baseline classifier), 
inspected how both performed on the provided image dataset and finally compared the outcomes.
